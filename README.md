# Clean Architecture Creator (CAC) by Yirsis Serrano

## CAC is a CLI tool that allows you to easily create the structure of a clean architecture

To install:

```bash
npm i -g bun@latest
```

```bash
bun install
```

```bash
bun run build
```

## Windows 10/11

A folder called `cac` will be created in the project. You must copy it to `C:\Program Files` in the case of Windows and add the path of the `cac\bin` folder to the system environment variables in the `Path` variable.

## Linux

If you are using Linux, you must add the tool to your system executables with Root permissions.
